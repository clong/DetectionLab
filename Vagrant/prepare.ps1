   This script is used to ensure prerequisites for DetectionLab 
   are properly installed.

.DESCRIPTION
   This scripts runs a series of tests. It checks:

   * If Packer and Vagrant are installed
   * If VirtualBox and/or VMware are installed
   * If the proper vagrant plugins are available
   * Various aspects of system health

   If you encounter issues, feel free to open an issue at
   https://github.com/clong/DetectionLab/issues


.EXAMPLE
  ./prepare.ps1

  This runs a series of checks to ensure your system will successfully be
  able to build DetectionLab.
