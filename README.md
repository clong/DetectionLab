## Purpose
This lab has been designed with defenders in mind. Its primary purpose is to allow the user to quickly build a Windows domain that comes pre-loaded with security tooling and some best practices when it comes to system logging configurations. It can easily be modified to fit most needs or expanded to include additional hosts.

Read more about Detection Lab on Medium here: https://medium.com/@clong/introducing-detection-lab-61db34bed6ae

NOTE: This lab has not been hardened in any way and runs with default vagrant credentials. Please do not connect or bridge it to any networks you care about. This lab is deliberately designed to be insecure; the primary purpose of it is to provide visibility and introspection into each host.

## Primary Lab Features:
* Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/advanced-threat-analytics) is installed on the WEF machine, with the lightweight ATA gateway installed on the DC
* A Splunk forwarder is pre-installed and all indexes are pre-created. Technology add-ons are also preconfigured.
* A custom Windows auditing configuration is set via GPO to include command line process auditing and additional OS-level logging
* [Palantir's Windows Event Forwarding](http://github.com/palantir/windows-event-forwarding)  subscriptions and custom channels are implemented
* Powershell transcript logging is enabled. All logs are saved to `\\wef\pslogs`
* osquery comes installed on each host and is pre-configured to connect to a [Fleet](https://kolide.co/fleet) server via TLS. Fleet is preconfigured with the configuration from [Palantir's osquery Configuration](https://github.com/palantir/osquery-configuration)
* Sysmon is installed and configured using [Olaf Hartong's open-sourced Sysmon configuration](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular)
* All autostart items are logged to Windows Event Logs via [AutorunsToWinEventLog](https://github.com/palantir/windows-event-forwarding/tree/master/AutorunsToWinEventLog)
* Zeek and Suricata are pre-configured to monitor and alert on network traffic
* Apache Guacamole is installed to easily access all hosts from your local browser
