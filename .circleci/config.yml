            ## As far as I'm aware, there are three possibile cases to check for here. The CIRCLE_COMPARE_URL environment variable will either contain:
            ## - A SHA1 hash for the commit (If there is only a single commit on the branch)
            ## - Two SHA1 hashes in a "xxxxxxxx..yyyyyyyy" (comparing the two most recent commits
            ## - Nothing
            ## There is certainly a better way to accomplish all of this, but my limited knowledge of git has lead me to write this awful spaghetti code :-/
